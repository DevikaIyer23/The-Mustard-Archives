# Problem Statement
Our project aims at building a consultancy platform that streamlines service delivery by connecting clients with skilled professionals. Clients browse and request diverse projects, while consultants and providers deliver their expertise. This platform will bridge the gap, ensuring clients get the services they need and the consultancy thrives with new projects. By implementing a strong database system, consultancy services can achieve significant improvements in operational efficiency, client service, and overall business performance.

# Problem Description
Currently consultancy services rely on extensive spreadsheets and manual entry to store and retrieve data pertaining to different professional services. This leads to distribution of extensive amounts of data across multiple systems and files thus making it difficult to access and report. This leads to loss in productivity as employees spend extensive amounts of time searching for and managing data. Lack of a centralized database also results in inefficient workflows and data redundancy. Thus it is essential to create a database which stores all the information pertaining to the different services available. This makes requesting for a service and initiating and working on projects more efficient for clients and also for the consultants building the project.
